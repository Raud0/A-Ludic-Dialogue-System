        <h2 id="title">A Ludic Dialogue System for Interactive Fiction</h2>
        <p>
            Since the beginning of video gaming,
            branching dialogue has been both
            a blessing and a curse.<br>
            It allowed players to talk to characters of fictious worlds.
            And not just talk, but talk interactively,
            as you would in tabletop role-playing games.
            However, it has always been an
            <b>expensive</b> experience to create,
            <b>limited</b> in its modifiability,
            and a <b>speedbump</b> in interactivity.
            To solve this, a new class of dialogue systems
            needs to exist, one that blends dialogue writing with procedures.

        <h2 id="title">How to make a game out of <i>Twelve Angry Men</i> (1957)?</h2>
        <p>
            To test out the freshly devised design of LUDIC DIALOGUE, it was necessary
            to create an experience that could demonstrate the viability of the system
            as a medium for not just art but for gaming. As a system, there were very few
            examples you could compare it to in the world of video games.

            The <i>LAST CALL</i> was made knowing the following:
            <ul>
                <li>It would have the ludic dialogue system as its <b>core element</b></li>
                <li>As such it would make use out of its <b>freeform conversational structure</b>></li>
                <li>And would <b>last for 15 minutes</b>, to show how dialogue could take place in real-time</li>
                <li>Because games are about <b>conflict</b>, the dialogue would be about conflict</li>
                <li>The conflict of trying to convince a disobeying officer to launch nukes at the soviet</li>
                <li>On the way, the conversation could go in many directions, some topics being like <b>conversational landmines</b></li>
                <li>As such, the game way built on the idea of a <b>deep interpersonal relationship</b> that would form between two people before the end of the world</li>
            </ul>
